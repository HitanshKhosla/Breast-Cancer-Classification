## Introduction

This project aims to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign using logistic regression. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, sourced from Kaggle. This project demonstrates basic data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using logistic regression.

## Dataset

The dataset is available from the [Kaggle Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). It contains 569 instances of malignant and benign tumor cells. Each instance has 30 features describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

- **Features**: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension, etc.
- **Target**: 
  - 0: Malignant
  - 1: Benign

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
   cd breast-cancer-classification
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**:
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the model**:
   Run the training script to train the logistic regression model.
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the model**:
   Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py
   ```



## Results

The logistic regression model achieved the following results:

- **Training Accuracy**: 62.81%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 62.57%
